# Events and Debugging Assessment

Time to assess how well you have learned to use the debugging tools in Chrome Dev Tools, and writing click event listeners. This application is to show kids with illnesses and the memories the would like to make. Celebrities sign up to help kids make memories.

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Event Listeners to Create

1. When the kid name is clicked, it should display their wish.
1. When the celebrity name is clicked, it should display their sport.
1. The pairings list should should contain the pairing in the following format.
    ```html
    {child name} will be making memories with {celebrity name}, a {celebrity sport} star, by {child wish}
    ```

Below is an animation showing how the application should look when complete and how the event listeners should work.

## Setup

Your instruction team will provide a link for you to create your assessment repository. Once your repo is created, clone it to your machine.

1. Make sure you are in your `workspace` directory.
1. `git clone {github repo SSH string}`.
1. `cd` into the directory it creates.
1. `code .` to open the project code.
1. Use the `serve` command to start the web server.
1. Open the URL provided in Chrome.

Make sure your Developer Tools are open at all times while working on this project. Use the messages provided in the Console to determine what code needs to be fixed or implemented, and use breakpoints in the Sources tab to step through your code as you debug.

## Vocabulary and Understanding

Before you click the "Complete Assessment" button on the Learning Platform, add your answers below each question and make a commit.

1. When a child is clicked on in the browser, which module contains the code that will execute on that event happening? Can you explain the algorithm of that logic?
   
   The Kids.js module is what is being executed. If dataset.type is correct, grab the dataset.celebid and match it to the celebrity id being iterated over, and display the message containing those interpolations. 

2. In the **Pairings** module, why must the `findCelebrityMatch()` function be invoked inside the `for..of` loop that iterates the kids array?
   
   You are finding the match for each child. You need to call that function for each new kid object.

3. In the **CelebrityList** module, can you describe how the name of the sport that the celebrity plays can be displayed in the window alert text?
   
   Because of the iteration of the for loop, we have access to the properties of the Celebrities array. We can then store that data in the DOM and pull it on the addEventListener. 

4. Can you describe, in detail, the algorithm that is in the `main` module?
   

   we are selecting the first container ID in index.HTML, assigning to a variable. We then assign dynamically updated HTML a variable(applicationHTML), and pass in the function return values of each function, that inturn, are also generating HTML to fill the variable(applicationHTML). We then use the mainContainer variable used to grab the ID, and update the HTML using .innerHTML and assigning it to the variable apllicationHTML.
